# Prototyping_Workshop
All documentation for the Prototyping workshop taught by LadyBrains Studio in Chicago 
You will need to include the .lib by adding it to the component libraries in Escheema. 
.pretty footprint files can be added with the footprint wizard in PCBnew


Artist Darcy Neal leads this workshop on building your own synthesizer. Read below for her description: 

We'll learn about some of the building blocks of creating a synthesizer using the 4046 VCO and the classic 40106 CMOS ICs.  The 4046 is a well documented and powerful IC that can be turned into a modular synth voice with just a few added components.  
Participants will learn to solder together their own prototyping PCB, build a circuit on a breadboard from a schematic, experiment with sensors, and learn the basics about how to produce custom circuit boards using design software like Kicad and Fritzing.  

No experience is necessary, but basic electronic knowledge or a strong interest in synths will be helpful.

Bring headphones for sure, and a laptop if you would like to view the extra files available for the course, which will be provided via github.  If you want to bring a laptop to look at the schematics and PCBs, you will need to download Fritzing and Kicad.  http://fritzing.org/download/  http://kicad-pcb.org/download/   

First, we'll start by assembling a prototyping development board that will help make building circuits easier.  It has a 9v battery, a TL072 active mixer with multiple inputs and a 3.5mm headphone output, along with potentiometers that are mounted so that they are easy to patch in to.  This project draws inspiration for the OMsynth solderless workshop created by Peter Edwards of Casper Electronics.  He has a more advanced prototyping setup available for sale and has some great tutorials to go along with it.  http://www.bastl-instruments.com/instruments/omsynth/

Next, we will build a simple synth with a 4046 VCO, and experiment with components like pushbuttons for a resistor ladder keyboard, LDRs, some etextile sensors and VCR tape w/ alligator clips.  Part of the emphasis of the class is experimentation, and getting comfortable with trying different things with the circuit. 

Then, if there's time, we'll cover the PCB software(s), and how to build a paper circuit for prototyping and order boards through OshPark. I should have $10 coupons available for  participants.  OSHpark donated the production of 72 copies of the workshop PCB in support of this learning series, so a major thank you for all that they do.   

Participants will take home a completed prototyping development board, and a variety of components to build their first interactive synth.  You will also get links to further reading material if you choose to continue learning about building synths.    

The Pumping Station: One workshop was hosted by the Women's Electronics Workshop series, which is committed to providing a safe space for electronics enthusiasts who identify as female or genderqueer. This event is open to everyone.
